I need caring staff who are genuinely interested in getting to know the essence of my personality; the things which I enjoy, the things which make me happy. I need the home to be aware when my whiteboard pens may need replenishing. 

I also need the home to involve me in daily activities. I love being the centre of attention from time to time and would hate the idea of missing out on something! I like it very much when (silly) Simon and Ben come to the home - they are fantastic and make me laugh. 

I need the home to be mindful that, at times, I may need to sit in a different part of the dayroom or even go to my room. I may become very loud and start to upset people. Equally, I may want to spend some time in my room to get away from other people. So, I need people who can sense these things and be proactive. Don't wait for me to escalate!","I like to remain active and engaged. I sometimes like to do jigsaws. I enjoy other puzzles from time to time, there are plenty in my room. I used to enjoy gardening a lot. What still brings me great joy is being surrounded by animals. I love it when Gizmo is in the house - it is so nice to be able to stroke a dog and show affection. 

Sometimes, when I am all worked up, reading magazines has a very soothing effect on me. There are lots in my room. I like reading about The Royal Family and have plenty of magazines about the them. 

I like most romantic novels. Some I will find a bit boring but I appreciate it when this type of book is given to me. 

I also like a good chat - come and talk to me and learn about East London!

I love being pampered - I love having several hairdressers in the building
I enjoy joining in with Simon from activities when he's singing songs we do like to sing together especially songs I grew up with in my younger years.",

Laura is technically my next of kin, she works in Yeovil and was a mental health nurse (that's what I used to do!)

I need my kids to know straight away if there is a problem with my health. ","I have very supportive children who have, in their own ways, been great to me recently. I lived in Spain with my husband for almost twenty years. Sadly, I lost my husband  and was having my own health issues. The children all want what is best for me and it has been hard for them. Hopefully i have more visits from my family i do know they are  busy with their own lives.

I like to talk about my family and have some lovely photographs in my bedroom of good times with them.

My daughter lives about two hours away but she still makes it once a week - what a girl she is. My Glen is quite the mummy's boy. He lives near Weymouth and is ever so busy but he keeps me on my toes and our squabbles are fun really!",

I need people not to upset my routine - don't even tease me too much because I may take things seriously.

I like to make frequent trips to the dentist. I always let Robin know when I have pain and he takes me to Alington Dental Practice on Poole Road. 

","I have no problems whatsover taking medication - no covert medication for me. Having a catheter is not a problem for me - I am so used to it now! I am a very determined and robust individual. In spite of my recent health issues, you will notice that I have great spirit and drive. And charisma!

When I have a problem, I will definitely be able to tell you what the problem is!

I need staff to be aware that the whiteboard and pens in my room are very helpful to me. Even if I don't write a lot myself (because you can hear me!) I do like to know what people are saying to me. 

Have you tried the flipcards? There are different sets of cards for different time of the day. For example, in the mornings, you only need to bring out the PINK (matches with the MARs!) set. Please leave the others in my room.  If all the cards are left out in the day room, I think we all know what will happen to them :) I have a calendar in my room which I like filled to know when I have visitor's.

I need staff to be aware that, owing to hearing difficulties, I may shout. This is not intentional and certainly not meant to annoy other residents. I just can't help it.  

My hearing aid batteries need changing every Monday","Well, perhaps my biggest strength is that I love to communicate. I am a very sociable person and I certainly need/love to be surrounded by people

Managing Fixation on Routine and Order:
Staff should strive to maintain a consistent routine for Doris wherever possible, as this helps reduce her anxiety.
Clearly communicate any changes in routine to her in a calm and reassuring manner, and provide an explanation to help her understand the situation.
Keep Doris’s environment as orderly as possible, ensuring her personal space and belongings are organized to her liking.

Addressing Interactions with Other Residents:
Be vigilant when Doris interacts with other residents, as she may insist on having ""her"" chair or complain about others' choices at meals. Staff should calmly redirect her attention, explaining that everyone has their own preferences and encouraging her to focus on her own needs.
If Doris accuses another resident of inappropriate behaviour, listen to her concerns respectfully and reassure her that staff will address the issue. Avoid escalating the situation and document the incident thoroughly.

Responding to Complaints about Hearing Aids:
Doris frequently breaks her hearing aids unintentionally and then complains about being deaf. Staff should ensure her hearing aids are checked regularly and assist her in using them correctly to minimize issues.
If her hearing aids are not functioning or she becomes upset, remain patient and offer alternative ways to communicate, such as writing things down or speaking slowly and clearly.

Managing Complaints of Pain and Medication Concerns:
Doris often complains of pain, but her family has highlighted a past addiction to painkillers. Staff should monitor her pain complaints carefully and document them in her care notes.
Only administer pain relief as prescribed on her eMAR and avoid offering additional painkillers unless directed by a medical professional. If her pain complaints persist or worsen, escalate the concern to her GP or CMHT.

Maintaining Calm and Non-Confrontational Communication:
Staff must remain calm, controlled, and polite when communicating with Doris, even when she is being extremely unreasonable or irrational.
Avoid engaging in confrontational discussions or trying to reason with her when she is upset. Instead, use a soothing tone and simple, reassuring language to de-escalate the situation.
Always remember that Doris’s behaviours stem from her dementia and brain damage, and she is not deliberately manipulative, even if she may present that way at times.

Documentation and Monitoring:
All incidents of challenging behaviour should be documented using ABC charts or the Behaviour Detail section on LMC. This information is vital for tracking patterns and providing evidence for further interventions.
Ensure that the care plan and behaviour documentation are updated regularly to reflect any changes in Doris’s behaviour or responses to medication.

Medication and External Support:
Doris was started on Trazodone in November 2024 to help manage her behaviours. Staff should monitor its effectiveness and document any side effects or ongoing challenges.
As the home has requested input from CMHT (December 2024), staff should work closely with the mental health team and implement any additional recommendations to support Doris.

Conclusion:
By maintaining a consistent routine, using calm and respectful communication, and documenting incidents thoroughly, staff can help manage Doris’s challenging behaviours while supporting her dignity and well-being. Ongoing input from CMHT and careful monitoring of her medication will ensure that her care remains appropriate and effective.","Overview:

Doris exhibits very challenging behaviour, primarily driven by her fixation on routine and order. She becomes very upset if things are not done in a specific way or if her perceived sense of order is disrupted. Doris can be unreasonable with other residents, insisting on having ""her"" chair and expressing frustration if others deviate from meal routines, such as not eating breakfast or lunch. She has a history of unintentionally breaking her hearing aids and then complaining about her hearing difficulties. Doris often complains of pain, and her family has disclosed a past addiction to painkillers. Although she was previously prescribed Risperidone, this was discontinued, and she was started on Trazodone in November 2024. The home has requested additional input from CMHT as of December 2024. Doris may falsely accuse other residents of inappropriate actions, which can further escalate situations.

Staff must remain calm, controlled, and polite when communicating with Doris, recognizing that her behaviours are influenced by her dementia and brain damage. It is important to avoid confrontational approaches and instead document incidents thoroughly using ABC charts or the Behaviour Detail section on LMC.",
