### AI Scoring Calculation Logic

```python
# Example: Falls Screening Automatic Calculation
def calculate_falls_risk(care_plan_text, log_entries):
    score = 0
    
    # Check falls history
    fall_keywords = ["fall", "fell", "trip", "stumble", "slip"]
    if any(keyword in care_plan_text.lower() for keyword in fall_keywords):
        score += 1
    
    # Check medication count (from medication list)
    medication_count = count_medications(care_plan_text)
    if medication_count >= 4:
        score += 1
    
    # Check disease diagnosis
    disease_keywords = ["dementia", "stroke", "parkinson", "alzheimer"]
    if any(keyword in care_plan_text.lower() for keyword in disease_keywords):
        score += 1
    
    # Check balance problems
    balance_keywords = ["balance", "unsteady", "dizzy", "vertigo", "unstable"]
    if any(keyword in care_plan_text.lower() for keyword in balance_keywords):
        score += 1
    
    # Check standing difficulty
    mobility_keywords = ["difficulty standing", "cannot stand", "unable to rise"]
    if any(keyword in care_plan_text.lower() for keyword in mobility_keywords):
        score += 1
    
    return score

# Example: MUST Nutrition Risk Calculation
def calculate_must_score(care_plan_text, weight_logs, height):
    score = 0
    
    # BMI calculation
    if weight_logs and height:
        latest_weight = weight_logs[-1]
        bmi = latest_weight / (height/100)**2
        if bmi < 18.5:
            score += 2
        elif 18.5 <= bmi <= 20:
            score += 1
    
    # Weight loss calculation
    if len(weight_logs) >= 2:
        weight_change = (weight_logs[0] - weight_logs[-1]) / weight_logs[0] * 100
        if weight_change > 10:
            score += 2
        elif 5 <= weight_change <= 10:
            score += 1
    
    # Fasting status
    fasting_keywords = ["nil by mouth", "NBM", "fasting", "no oral intake"]
    if any(keyword in care_plan_text.lower() for keyword in fasting_keywords):
        score += 2
    
    return score
```

### Automatic Assessment Trigger Conditions

#### Immediate Triggers:
- New fall incident recorded → Recalculate Falls Screening
- Weight record change >5% → Recalculate MUST
- Skin condition change recorded → Recalculate Waterlow
- Pain-related records → Recalculate Abbey Pain Scale

#### Scheduled Triggers:
- Weekly: Falls Screening, MUST
- Monthly: Waterlow, Abbey Pain Scale
- Quarterly: Cornell Depression Scale
- Bi-annually: Moving and Handling Assessment

## Notes
1. All assessment tools should be regularly re-evaluated
2. Score changes should trigger care plan reviews
3. High-risk scores require immediate action and supervision
4. Assessment results should be recorded in personal care files
5. Complies with CQC Regulation 12 requirements, ensuring evidence-based, actionable, and trackable assessments
6. AI should automatically identify keywords and calculate risk scores
7. System should provide traceable scoring evidence and recommendations
